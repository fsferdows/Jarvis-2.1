## 🧠 How Emotion Detection Works

JARVIS analyzes your command for emotional words:

```
Command: "Please urgently help me send a WhatsApp message!"

Analysis:
├─ "Please" → Needs help (concern)
├─ "urgently" → Time-sensitive (concern + energetic)
├─ "help me" → Asking for assistance (understanding + concern)
└─ Combined emotion: CONCERNED + UNDERSTANDING

Response tone: Reassuring + Helpful + Empathetic
Indicators: 🤝 ⚠️ 💙 (respect + understanding + care)

Final response: "⚠️ Don't worry, I've got this! Opening WhatsApp
               and preparing your message. 🤝"
```

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Use Natural Language

```
❌ "app_open whatsapp send_message"  (Too robotic)
✅ "Hey, can you open WhatsApp and send a message?"  (Natural)
```

### 2. Express Your Emotion

```
❌ "Open WhatsApp"  (Neutral, less emotional)
✅ "Please help me open WhatsApp urgently!"  (Concerned, emotional)

→ JARVIS responds more emotionally and helpfully!
```

### 3. Mix Emotions

```
"I love your help, but I urgently need to send this message to Abbu"
→ JARVIS detects: Happy + Concerned + Urgent
→ Response is uplifting + reassuring + fast!
```

### 4. Give Context

```
❌ "Send message"  (Ambiguous)
✅ "Send a thank you message to Abbu via WhatsApp"  (Clear context)

→ JARVIS understands better and executes faster!
```
